Frontend App


Build it with any front end framework you know :


1) The home page should display a table with a list of products. The attributes to display would be Product Name, Price & Quantity
2) The table should have edit functionality where a button will open a popup to edit the product details.
3) There should be an "add new" button which should open a popup to accept new product info & should add it to the table.
4) There should be a search box to search products. Search should happen on the product name.


Link the above app with Backend APIs (Fast API/Flask/Django)
1) API to save new additions & updates of products.
2) API to return search results based on the query.


Storage
1) Save the additions & updations of products in any relational db
